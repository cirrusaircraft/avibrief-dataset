# AVIBRIEF: Automated Vocal Informational Briefings Dataset 

**Description:** The dataset includes approximately 1.4 hours of audio data from ATIS, AWOS and ASOS informational broadcasts. The audio files will be accompanied by human annotated and verified transcriptions. In addition to the text transcript, we also provide gold annotations for named entity recognition tasks (e.g.: recognizing the correct digits for altimeter settings in an ATIS broadcast). Our dataset includes audio recordings from over 180 US airports, captured using a variety of collection methods including ground scanners, telephone calls, and aircraft-based radio systems. This diverse set of recordings allows for analysis of different noise levels and operational environments encountered during aviation communication. 

**Availability:** Thank you for your interest in this dataset. This dataset will be published on this site towards the **end of August 2023**.
